# Task: [ID] - [NAME]

**Status**: Pending
**Created**: [DATE] | **Completed**: N/A
**User Story**: [STORY ID] (e.g., US1)
**Requirement**: [REQ ID] (e.g., FR-005)

## Lifecycle Markers

<!--
  Script-managed. Do NOT hand-edit. (v0.3+)
  Populated by scripts/{bash,powershell}/stamp-lifecycle.{sh,ps1}.
  Task files carry BOTH lifecycles: authoring (during /atomicspec.tasks)
  and implementation (during /atomicspec.implement). See Article IX,
  Directive 9 for the Orientation Read Surface that consumes these.
  Optional verify-depth field (light|deep) is set by the authoring AI
  (during /atomicspec.tasks) and obeyed — not re-decided — by the
  resuming AI in Phase 0.
  Empty section = legacy / pre-v0.3 artifact, treated as `legacy_closed`.

## 📋 Embedded Context (READ THIS FIRST)

<!--
  SELF-CONTAINED TASK (Constitution Directive 8):
  This section contains ALL context needed to implement this task.
  Do NOT read plan.md, spec.md, stations, or subagents.

  If this section is empty or insufficient, report as task quality issue.
-->

### Project Standards (from registry)

<!--
  Extracted from specs/_defaults/registry.yaml during /atomicspec.tasks
  If no registry exists, this section will note "No registry - using plan.md decisions"
-->

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `architecture.pattern` | [e.g., monolith, microservices] |
| `architecture.layers` | [e.g., clean, vertical_slice, mvc] |
| `code_patterns.data_access` | [e.g., repository, active_record, query_builder] |
| `code_patterns.error_handling` | [e.g., exceptions, result_type, error_codes] |
| `code_patterns.validation_approach` | [e.g., schema, manual, decorator] |
| `database.tenancy_model` | [e.g., shared_db_tenant_id, separate_schema] |
| `conventions.files` | [e.g., kebab-case, snake_case, PascalCase] |
| `conventions.variables` | [e.g., camelCase, snake_case] |

### Domain Rules (from subagent/station)

<!--
  Extracted from relevant .specify/subagents/[domain].md or
  .specify/knowledge/stations/[XX]-[domain].md during /atomicspec.tasks

  If no domain knowledge exists, note: "No domain knowledge - using plan.md decisions"
-->

- **[Rule Category]**: [Rule description]
- **[Rule Category]**: [Rule description]
- **Example**: Tenancy: Every query MUST filter by `tenant_id`
- **Example**: No naked queries: All DB access through repository methods only

### API Context (from contracts/)

<!--
  Extracted from FEATURE_DIR/contracts/ if this task involves API endpoints.
  If no contracts exist or not applicable, this section can be removed.
-->

```yaml
# Relevant endpoints for this task
[METHOD] [PATH] → [function](params)
```

### Feature Summary

<!--
  One paragraph summarizing the feature this task belongs to.
  Extracted from plan.md during /atomicspec.tasks generation.
-->

[Brief description of the feature and its purpose]

### Gate Criteria (from subagent/station)

<!--
  Checklist items extracted from the relevant subagent or station.
  These MUST be verified before marking the task complete.
-->

- [ ] [Gate criterion 1]
- [ ] [Gate criterion 2]
- [ ] [Gate criterion 3]

## 🎯 Objective

[Specific, atomic goal of this single task]

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

<!--
  CONTEXT PINNING:
  This section contains ALL the info needed to write code.
  Do not look at plan.md.
-->

### Files to Create

<!--
  List NEW files this task creates from scratch.
  Include the full path from repo root.
-->

- `src/path/to/new-file.ts` - [purpose of this file]
- `tests/path/to/new-test.ts` - [what it tests]

### Files to Update (REQUIRED)

<!--
  ⚠️ CRITICAL: This section prevents orphan code.

  If you create a new file, something MUST import/use it.
  List ALL existing files that need changes to wire in the new code.

  If this section is empty, ask: "How will users access this feature?"
-->

- `src/main.ts` - [what to add, e.g., "Register new router"]
- `src/components/Navigation.tsx` - [what to add, e.g., "Add link to new page"]
- `src/stores/index.ts` - [what to add, e.g., "Export new store"]

### Code/Logic Requirements

- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Input/Output signature]
- [Station Rule: e.g., "Must use tenant_id in query"]
