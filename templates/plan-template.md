# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/atomicspec.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Lifecycle Markers

<!--
  Script-managed. Do NOT hand-edit. (v0.3+)
  Populated by scripts/{bash,powershell}/stamp-lifecycle.{sh,ps1} during
  /atomicspec.plan. Authoring lifecycle only — plan.md is never "implemented"
  (Article IX, Directive 9). Empty section = legacy / pre-v0.3 artifact,
  treated as `legacy_closed`.

## Planning Configuration

<!--
  This section is filled during the Initial Configuration phase of /atomicspec.plan.
  The AI interviews the user using AskUserQuestion to gather preferences.

| Subagents | [Enabled/Disabled] |
| Available Subagents | [list or "None"] |
| Competitive Analysis | [Yes/No/Pending] |
| Review Depth | [Full/Quick/Auto] |

**Subagent Details** (if enabled):

  ============================================================================
  CONSTITUTION ARTICLE IX COMPLIANCE: GATE COMPLIANCE (Directive 4)

  Before this plan can proceed to task generation, the following Knowledge
  Station gates MUST be verified:

  - Station 06 (API Contracts): OpenAPI covers MVP, error schema standardized
  - Station 07 (Data Architecture): Tenancy model documented, isolation plan exists
  - Station 08 (Auth & RBAC): ADRs exist, permission matrix defined
  - Station 12 (CI/CD): Environments spec exists, release checklist defined
  - Station 13 (Security): Threat model MVP exists, security baseline checked

  This is NON-NEGOTIABLE per the Constitution.
  ============================================================================

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  🛑 STOP: MANDATORY GATES - ARCHITECTURE STATIONS

  BEFORE planning the architecture, you MUST read and verify gates for ALL relevant stations:

  📋 STATION 06 - API Contracts (IF API involved)
  READ: `.specify/knowledge/stations/06-api-contracts.md`
  GATES:
  - [ ] OpenAPI/contract covers all MVP endpoints
  - [ ] Error schema is standardized (error.code, error.message, requestId)
  - [ ] Tenant scoping is consistent across all endpoints
  - [ ] Idempotency strategy defined for mutations

  📋 STATION 07 - Data Architecture (IF Database involved)
  READ: `.specify/knowledge/stations/07-data-architecture.md`
  GATES:
  - [ ] Tenancy model documented (Shared DB/Schema, Shared DB/Sep Schema, Sep DB)
  - [ ] Enforcement pattern defined (server-side only, no naked queries)
  - [ ] Baseline entities included (Tenant, User, Membership, Role, etc.)
  - [ ] Isolation test plan exists

  📋 STATION 08 - Auth & RBAC (IF Auth involved)
  READ: `.specify/knowledge/stations/08-auth-rbac.md`
  GATES:
  - [ ] ADRs exist for auth decisions (Session vs JWT)
  - [ ] Permission Matrix defined (Roles → Permissions)
  - [ ] Membership requirement documented
  - [ ] Billing/Limit integration into auth flow specified

  📋 STATION 12 - CI/CD & Release (ALWAYS)
  READ: `.specify/knowledge/stations/12-cicd-release.md`
  GATES:
  - [ ] Environments Spec defined (Local, Dev, Staging, Prod)
  - [ ] CI Pipeline Spec defined (Lint, Tests, Security scans)
  - [ ] Release Checklist exists (migrations, feature flags, monitoring)

  📋 STATION 13 - Security Baseline (ALWAYS)
  READ: `.specify/knowledge/stations/13-security.md`
  GATES:
  - [ ] Threat Model MVP defined (top threats identified)
  - [ ] Security Baseline Checklist completed
  - [ ] Rate limiting strategy defined for auth endpoints

  If ANY gate cannot be satisfied, STOP and document what's missing.

  - Version compatibility
  - Security advisories

  The user then reviews findings in Phase 0.7 and either:
  - Accepts recommendations
  - Provides alternatives
  - Overrides with documented reason

  DO NOT proceed to Phase 1 until validation is complete.
