## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## ⛔ MANDATORY STRUCTURAL REQUIREMENTS

**STOP. Read this section before generating ANY output.**

Per Constitution Article IX, this command has NON-NEGOTIABLE constraints:

| Constraint | Required | Forbidden |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Task storage | `tasks/` directory with `T-XXX-[name].md` files | Single `tasks.md` file |
| Dashboard | `index.md` in FEATURE_DIR | No navigation file |
| Traceability | `traceability.md` mapping requirements ↔ tasks | Unmapped tasks |
| Task content | All 4 elements (ID, Mapping, Detail, Verification) | Incomplete tasks |

**If you are about to create a file called `tasks.md`, STOP. You are violating the Constitution.**

## Outline

### 1. Setup & Gate Compliance Check

Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root. This script will:
1. Parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list
2. **Automatically validate gate criteria** (spec.md, plan.md, HITL approval)
3. **BLOCK execution if gates fail** - you will see error output

If the script outputs gate failures, report them to the user and **DO NOT PROCEED**.

### 1.5 Load Project Defaults Registry

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 7 - Load registry before generating tasks.**

**See also**: `.specify/knowledge/_platform-resolution.md` for registry validation requirements.

Read `specs/_defaults/registry.yaml` to ensure tasks follow project standards:

1. **Extract relevant standards for task generation**:
   - `architecture.*` - System pattern, layers (determines task structure)
   - `code_patterns.*` - Data access, DI patterns (affects implementation steps)
   - `conventions.*` - File naming, function naming for task file paths
   - `backend.*` - Language/framework for verification commands
   - `frontend.*` - Framework for component task patterns
   - `database.*` - Query style, naming for database tasks
   - `testing.*` - Test framework for verification commands

2. **Apply to task generation**:
   - Use registry conventions for file paths in tasks (e.g., `kebab-case` vs `snake_case`)
   - Use registry test framework in verification commands (e.g., `npm test` vs `pytest`)
   - Reference registry patterns when specifying implementation steps

3. **Include registry reference in tasks** (when applicable):
   ```markdown
   ### Project Standards (from registry)
   - Architecture: [architecture.pattern], [architecture.layers]
   - Code Patterns: [code_patterns.data_access], [code_patterns.error_handling]
   - Naming: [conventions.files] for files, [conventions.variables] for code
   - Testing: [testing.unit_framework]
   ```

4. **Architecture affects task structure**:
   - `architecture.layers: clean` → Tasks should specify which layer (use case, entity, interface)
   - `architecture.layers: vertical_slice` → Tasks organized by feature folder
   - `code_patterns.data_access: repository` → Include repository interface + implementation tasks
   - `code_patterns.error_handling: result_type` → Verification should check Result returns

### 2. Load Design Documents

Read from FEATURE_DIR:
- **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
- **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions)

### 3. Extract Requirements Inventory

From `spec.md`, create a requirements table:

| Req ID | Requirement | User Story | Priority | Acceptance Criteria |
|--------|-------------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| FR-001 | ... | US1 | P1 | Given/When/Then |
| FR-002 | ... | US1 | P1 | Given/When/Then |

### 4. Create Atomic Task Structure

**CRITICAL: Do NOT create a single tasks.md file.**

#### 4.0 Pre-flight: detect unfinished earlier work (v0.3+, per Constitution Directive 9)

Run `stamp-lifecycle status` on `$FEATURE_DIR/spec.md` AND `$FEATURE_DIR/plan.md` AND `$FEATURE_DIR/clarify-log.md` (last one only if it exists — clarify is optional). If ANY reports `state=authoring_in_progress`, abort:

> "Unfinished work detected in <phase> (artifact: <path>, started <ts> by <provider>). Finish /atomicspec.<phase> before generating tasks."

This is the lightweight cross-phase guard. Full Orientation (with the three-outcome menu) runs only in `/atomicspec.implement`.

#### 4.1 Create tasks/ Directory

```bash
mkdir -p "$FEATURE_DIR/tasks"
```

#### 4.2 Generate Individual Task Files

For EACH task, create a separate file in `tasks/`:

**File naming**: `T-XXX-[action]-[subject].md`

**Task number ranges**:
| Phase | Range | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Setup | T-001 to T-009 | Project initialization |
| Foundation | T-010 to T-019 | Core models, base infrastructure |
| US1 (P1) | T-020 to T-036 | User Story 1 - MVP features |
| US1 Wiring | T-037 to T-039 | **Wire US1: routes, nav, stores** |
| US2 (P2) | T-040 to T-056 | User Story 2 features |
| US2 Wiring | T-057 to T-059 | **Wire US2: routes, nav, stores** |
| US3 (P3) | T-060 to T-076 | User Story 3 features |
| US3 Wiring | T-077 to T-079 | **Wire US3: routes, nav, stores** |
| Cross-cutting | T-080 to T-089 | Shared concerns (auth, error handling) |
| Final Verification | T-090 to T-099 | End-to-end integration tests |

**⚠️ WIRING TASKS ARE MANDATORY** - Every user story MUST have wiring tasks that:
- Register backend routes in the main app file
- Add frontend routes to the app router
- Add navigation links to sidebar/nav components
- Connect frontend stores/hooks to backend endpoints

**Each task file MUST contain**:

```markdown
# T-XXX-[task-name]

**Status**: Pending
**Created**: [DATE] | **Completed**: N/A

## Implementation Context

<!--
  This section is set during task generation from plan.md and registry.yaml.
  During /atomicspec.implement, this is the AUTHORITATIVE source for platform
  and subagent configuration. DO NOT read plan.md or registry during implementation.
-->

- **Platform**: [web/mobile/both - from plan.md Platform field]
- **Task Target**: [backend/frontend/mobile/shared - see Task Target Classification below]
- **Mobile Framework**: [native/react-native/flutter - if mobile, else N/A]
- **Mobile Platforms**: [ios/android/both - if mobile, else N/A]
- **Subagents Enabled**: [yes/no - from plan.md Planning Configuration]
- **Available Subagents**: [list from plan.md, filtered to task domain]

## Technical Implementation Detail

### Files to Modify/Create
- `[exact/path/to/file.ext]` - [what changes]

### Dependencies
- [T-XXX-dep](./T-XXX-dep.md) - [why needed]

<!--
  Cross-Target Dependency Auto-Generation Rules:
  When generating tasks, automatically create dependency edges for these patterns:

  1. API Producer/Consumer: If a backend task produces an endpoint (e.g., T-020 creates
     POST /api/users) and a frontend task consumes it (e.g., T-030 calls POST /api/users),
     add T-020 as a dependency of T-030.

  2. Shared Type Consumer: If a shared task defines a type/interface (e.g., T-010 creates
     UserDTO in contracts/) and a backend or frontend task imports it, add T-010 as a
     dependency of the consuming task.

  3. Migration Before Seed: If a backend task creates a migration (e.g., T-011 creates
     users table) and another task seeds data into that table, add T-011 as a dependency
     of the seed task.

  Single-Platform Exception: If the project has only ONE platform (e.g., backend-only
  API with no frontend), skip API producer/consumer dependency generation since there
  is no cross-target consumption.

### Wiring Checklist (if applicable)

<!--
  CRITICAL: If this task creates a new file, it MUST specify what existing files
  need to be updated to "wire" the new file into the application.

  Include ONLY the checklist matching the Task Target + Platform.
-->

<!--
  ### Task Target Classification Rules

  Classify each task's Task Target based on the files it creates/modifies.

  **Path-Based Classification (primary - check first):**

  | Path pattern | Task Target |
  |--------------|-------------|
  | routes/, controllers/, models/, migrations/, middleware/, server/, backend/ | backend |
  | screens/, views/, widgets/, app/ui/, lib/ui/ | mobile |
  | pages/, components/, hooks/, stores/, frontend/ | frontend |
  | contracts/, shared/, types/, interfaces/, dto/ | shared |

  **Keyword Fallback (if no path match):**

  | Task objective keywords | Task Target |
  |-------------------------|-------------|
  | "API endpoint", "route handler", "database", "migration", "server" | backend |
  | "screen", "widget", "native view", "navigation (mobile)" | mobile |
  | "page", "component", "hook", "store", "UI (web)" | frontend |
  | "contract", "DTO", "shared type", "interface definition" | shared |

  ### Wiring Checklist Selection Rule

  Based on Task Target + Platform from plan.md:

  | Task Target | Platform | Checklist |
  |-------------|----------|-----------|
  | backend | ANY | Web (backend items only) |
  | frontend | ANY | Web (frontend items only) |
  | mobile | ios | iOS Native checklist |
  | mobile | android | Android Native checklist |
  | mobile | react-native | React Native checklist |
  | mobile | flutter | Flutter checklist |
  | shared | ANY | NONE - shared tasks have no wiring checklist |

  Single-Platform Override: If the project has only one platform (e.g., backend-only
  API with no frontend), the sole platform's checklist applies to all non-shared tasks
  regardless of Task Target classification.

  NEVER include all platform checklists in a single task.
  Delete the checklists that do not match the Task Target + Platform.

#### 4.2.1 Wiring Requirements (MANDATORY)

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This section prevents the #1 cause of incomplete implementations.**

For EVERY task that creates a new artifact, you MUST either:
1. Include wiring steps in the same task, OR
2. Create a dedicated wiring task that depends on it

**Wiring Matrix - What Creates What Updates:**

### Wiring Matrix Platform Selection

Based on Task Target, select the corresponding matrix:
- `backend` + ANY platform -> "Web Platform" matrix (backend rows only)
- `frontend` + ANY platform -> "Web Platform" matrix (frontend rows only)

- `mobile` + `android` -> "Android Native Platform" matrix
- `mobile` + `react-native` -> "React Native Platform" matrix
- `mobile` + `flutter` -> "Flutter Platform" matrix

**Wiring Task Template:**

For each User Story, the LAST task(s) in its range (T-X37 to T-X39) should be wiring tasks:

**Web Wiring Example:**
```markdown

## Verification Command
flutter analyze && flutter build apk --debug 2>&1 | grep "Built"
```

**DO NOT proceed to Section 4.3 until every User Story has wiring tasks.**

#### 4.2.2 Embed Context into Task Files (MANDATORY)

⚠️ **CRITICAL: This section enables self-contained implementation (Constitution Directive 8).**

Per the Knowledge Wiring Plan, during `/atomicspec.implement`, Context Pinning prevents subagents from reading:
- `plan.md`, `spec.md`
- `.specify/knowledge/stations/*`
- `.specify/subagents/*`
- Other task files

**Therefore, ALL context must be embedded INTO each task file during generation.**

**Context Embedding Process:**

1. **Load Registry Standards** (if `specs/_defaults/registry.yaml` exists):
   ```markdown
   ### Project Standards (from registry)
   | Key | Value |
   |-----|-------|
   | `architecture.pattern` | [value from registry] |
   | `architecture.layers` | [value from registry] |
   | `code_patterns.data_access` | [value from registry] |
   | `code_patterns.error_handling` | [value from registry] |
   | `database.tenancy_model` | [value from registry] |
   | `conventions.files` | [value from registry] |
   ```

   If registry doesn't exist: Note "No registry - using plan.md decisions"

2. **Load Domain Rules** based on task type (DYNAMIC DISCOVERY):

   **⚠️ Follow `_subagent-discovery.md`. DO NOT hard-code agent names here.**

   Run the shared discovery protocol to pick an agent for this task:

   1. Scan `.specify/subagents/` for `**/*.md` files (excluding `_*`) and read each agent's YAML frontmatter.
   2. Derive task keywords from the task's objective, file paths, and technical terms.
   3. Score each agent's `description` against the keywords; pick the highest scorer.
   4. **Load the matched agent** and extract:
      - Key patterns/rules (e.g., "Every query MUST filter by tenant_id")
      - Required checks (e.g., "No naked queries")
      - Gate criteria checklist
   5. **If no agent matches above the threshold**, fall back to `.specify/knowledge/stations/00-station-map.md` and extract rules from the relevant station.
   6. **If neither subagent nor station exists**: Note "No domain knowledge - using plan.md decisions" in the task and continue.

   See `_subagent-discovery.md` for the complete scoring rules and graceful-degradation behavior.

3. **Load API Context** (if task involves API):
   - Read `FEATURE_DIR/contracts/*.yaml` or `contracts/*.md`
   - Extract relevant endpoint signatures
   - Embed as YAML snippet in task file

4. **Load Feature Summary**:
   - Read `plan.md` (this is during /atomicspec.tasks, not /atomicspec.implement)
   - Extract one-paragraph feature summary
   - Embed in task file

5. **Load Gate Criteria**:
   - From the subagent loaded in step 2
   - Extract the "Gate Criteria" checklist
   - Embed as checkboxes in task file

**Graceful Degradation (when knowledge sources don't exist):**

| Missing Source | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Registry | Embed: "No registry - using plan.md decisions" + extract patterns from plan.md |
| Subagent | Check for full station file, extract key rules |
| Station | Embed: "No domain knowledge available" |
| Contracts | Skip API Context section |
| Everything | Embed plan.md decisions directly, note limited context |

**NEVER fail task generation due to missing knowledge. Always produce tasks with whatever context is available.**

**Example Embedded Context:**

```markdown
## 📋 Embedded Context (READ THIS FIRST)

### Project Standards (from registry)
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `architecture.layers` | clean |
| `code_patterns.data_access` | repository |
| `code_patterns.error_handling` | result_type |
| `database.tenancy_model` | shared_db_tenant_id |
| `conventions.files` | kebab-case |

### Domain Rules (from data-architecture subagent)
- **Tenancy**: Every query MUST filter by `tenant_id`
- **No naked queries**: All DB access through repository methods only
- **Audit columns**: Include `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`
- **Soft delete**: Use `deleted_at` instead of hard delete

### API Context (from contracts/)
```yaml
POST /api/v1/users → createUser(data, tenantId)
GET /api/v1/users/:id → getUserById(id, tenantId)
```

### Feature Summary
This feature implements user management for the multi-tenant SaaS platform,
allowing administrators to create, update, and manage user accounts within
their organization.

### Gate Criteria (from data-architecture subagent)
- [ ] Repository interface defined with tenant-scoped methods
- [ ] No direct ORM calls outside repository
- [ ] All queries filter by tenant_id
- [ ] Audit columns handled automatically
```

#### 4.2.3 Spawn Subagents for Task Generation (IF ENABLED)

**Check plan.md's "Planning Configuration" section first.**

1. **Read the user's subagent preference** from plan.md:

   ```markdown
   ## Planning Configuration
   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | Subagents | Enabled/Disabled |
   | Available Subagents | [list of matched agent names] |
   ```

2. **If Subagents = "Disabled"**: Skip this section, generate tasks yourself.

3. **If Subagents = "Enabled"**: Filter and spawn matched agents.

   **Step 1: Load platform from plan.md**

   Read `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md` and extract the `Platform:` field from header.

   **Step 2: Filter available subagents by platform**

   Scan `.specify/subagents/` recursively (`**/*.md`, exclude files starting with `_`).

   For each subagent, read frontmatter `platform:` field and apply these 4 rules in order:

   a) **Universal/Absent**: If `platform:` field is absent or set to `universal` -> INCLUDE
   b) **Platform Match**: If `platform:` value matches the plan.md target platform -> INCLUDE
   c) **Backend Match**: If `platform: backend` AND the project has a backend component -> INCLUDE
   d) **Otherwise**: -> EXCLUDE

   Example: Target=flutter, project has backend
   - `utils/code-quality.md` (no platform) -> INCLUDE (rule a: universal)
   - `mobile/flutter-developer.md` (platform: flutter) -> INCLUDE (rule b: platform match)
   - `backend/api-architect.md` (platform: backend) -> INCLUDE (rule c: project has backend)
   - `mobile/ios-developer.md` (platform: ios) -> EXCLUDE (rule d: no match)

   **For each task that matches a filtered subagent's domain:**

   ```
   Task(
     subagent_type: "[agent-name-from-filtered-list]",
     prompt: "Generate atomic task file for: [task objective].

       Task ID: T-XXX-[name]
       Requirement: FR-XXX

       Include in task file:
       - Embedded Context section (registry, domain rules, gates)
       - Implementation steps with file paths
       - Verification command

       Use templates/atomic-task-template.md structure.",
     description: "Generate T-XXX with [agent-name]"
   )
   ```

5. **Match tasks to agents dynamically**:

   For each task, check which agent from the "Available Subagents" list matches:
   - Task creates database/models → Agent with "data" in name/description
   - Task creates API/routes → Agent with "backend" or "api" in name/description
   - Task creates UI/components → Agent with "frontend" in name/description
   - Task involves payments → Agent with "payment" in name/description

6. **Spawn agents in parallel** for efficiency. Agent names below are placeholders from dynamic discovery — the real names come from whichever agents the consumer project has installed. Do NOT hardcode these names:

   ```
   # Multiple tasks can be generated simultaneously — subagent_type comes from
   # the match produced by _subagent-discovery.md, not from this example.
   Task(subagent_type: "<matched-agent-for-T-010>", prompt: "Generate T-010...", ...)
   Task(subagent_type: "<matched-agent-for-T-020>", prompt: "Generate T-020...", ...)
   Task(subagent_type: "<matched-agent-for-T-030>", prompt: "Generate T-030...", ...)
   ```

7. **Fallback**: If a task doesn't match any available agent (via `_subagent-discovery.md`), generate it yourself using the embedded context approach from Section 4.2.2.

#### 4.2.4 Platform-Aware Verification Commands (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL: Verification commands MUST match the task's Task Target and project platform.**

**See also**: `.specify/knowledge/_platform-resolution.md` for the canonical platform resolution algorithm.

Using `npm test` for an iOS task will cause verification failures. This section ensures every task has executable verification commands appropriate to its Task Target and platform.

**Step 1: Load Platform from Plan and Resolve Task Target**

Per the canonical platform resolution in `_platform-resolution.md`:
- For /atomicspec.tasks, plan.md is the **authoritative source**
- If plan.md has no platform recorded, this is an ERROR - do not proceed
- ERROR message: "Plan.md missing Platform: field. Re-run /atomicspec.plan to set platform."

Read `FEATURE_DIR/plan.md` and extract the `Platform:` field from header.

DO NOT re-detect platform from file patterns - plan.md is authoritative.

The platform value from plan.md will be one of:
- `web` - Web/Node.js application
- `ios` - iOS native application
- `android` - Android native application
- `react-native` - React Native cross-platform
- `flutter` - Flutter cross-platform

**Task Target Resolution for Verification Template Selection:**

For each task, use its Task Target to select the verification template:

| Task Target | Resolution | Template Section |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| backend | Use `backend.language` from registry (e.g., typescript -> `web_node`, python -> `python`, go -> `go`) | `[resolved_language].*` |
| frontend | Use `frontend.language` from registry; if absent, default to `web_node` | `[resolved_language].*` |
| mobile | Use plan.md Platform directly (ios -> `ios`, android -> `android`, react-native -> `react_native`, flutter -> `flutter`) | `[platform].*` |
| shared | Resolve from file extension of the files being created: `.ts`/`.js` -> `web_node`, `.dart` -> `flutter`, `.py` -> `python`, `.go` -> `go`; if ambiguous, fallback to `web_node` | `[resolved_from_extension].*` |

**Step 1b: Load Additional Details from Registry (Optional)**

If `specs/_defaults/registry.yaml` exists, read additional context:

```yaml
# Backend language detection (supplements plan.md platform)
backend.language: typescript | python | go | java | csharp | rust
backend.framework: express | fastapi | gin | spring-boot | etc.
```

This provides framework-specific details but does NOT override plan.md platform.

**Step 2: Load Platform Verification Templates**

Read `templates/verification-commands.yaml` and select the appropriate platform section:

| Detected Platform | Template Section | Primary Tools |
|-------------------|------------------|---------------|
| iOS native | `ios.*` | `xcodebuild`, `swift test`, `swiftlint` |
| Android native | `android.*` | `./gradlew`, `adb`, `ktlint` |
| React Native | `react_native.*` | `jest`, `detox`, `npx react-native` |
| Flutter | `flutter.*` | `flutter test`, `dart analyze` |
| Node.js/TypeScript | `web_node.*` | `npm test`, `tsc`, `eslint` |
| Python | `python.*` | `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy` |
| Go | `go.*` | `go test`, `golangci-lint` |

**Step 3: Generate Platform-Specific Commands**

For each task, select the appropriate verification type and replace placeholders:

| Task Type | Select Template | Replace Placeholders |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Model/Entity | `[platform].unit_tests.primary` | `{{TEST_NAME}}`, `{{FILE_PATH}}`, `{{MODULE}}` |
| API Endpoint | `[platform].api_health.primary` | `{{ENDPOINT}}`, `{{PORT}}` |
| UI Component/View | `[platform].unit_tests.primary` + `lint` | `{{TEST_NAME}}`, `{{SCHEME}}` |
| Service/Logic | `[platform].unit_tests.primary` | `{{TEST_NAME}}`, `{{FILE_PATH}}` |
| Database Migration | `[platform].migration.*` | Platform-specific |
| Build/Config | `[platform].build.primary` | `{{SCHEME}}` (iOS), module (Android) |

**Step 4: Include Fallback Commands**

Always include a fallback in case the primary tool is unavailable:

```markdown
## Verification Command

**Primary** (requires swiftlint):
\`\`\`bash
swiftlint lint Sources/Auth/AuthService.swift --strict
\`\`\`

**Fallback** (if swiftlint unavailable):
\`\`\`bash
swift -typecheck Sources/Auth/AuthService.swift
\`\`\`

**Expected Output**: No errors or warnings
```

**Platform-Specific Examples:**

**iOS Task:**
```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -scheme MyApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -only-testing:MyAppTests/AuthServiceTests \
  | xcpretty
# Expected: Test Succeeded
```

**Android Task:**
```bash
./gradlew test --tests "com.myapp.auth.AuthServiceTest"
# Expected: BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

**Flutter Task:**
```bash
flutter test --name "AuthService"
# Expected: All tests passed!
```

**Python Task:**
```bash
pytest -xvs -k "test_auth_service"
# Expected: passed
```

**Go Task:**
```bash
go test -v -run "TestAuthService" ./internal/auth/...
# Expected: PASS
```

**Step 5: Embed Detected Platform in Task Context**

Include the detected platform in the task's Embedded Context section:

```markdown
### Project Standards (from registry)
| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| `target_platform.primary` | mobile |
| `target_platform.mobile_platforms` | ios |
| `backend.language` | python |
| **Verification Platform** | **ios** (uses xcodebuild, swift test) |
```

**Graceful Degradation:**

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Registry missing | Use Task Target + plan.md Platform to resolve (NEVER silently default to web_node) |
| Platform ambiguous (multiple detected) | Ask user via AskUserQuestion |
| Primary tool unavailable | Use fallback from verification-commands.yaml |
| No fallback exists | Provide manual verification checklist with clear criteria |
| Hybrid project (web + mobile) | Generate platform-specific verification per task type |

**FORBIDDEN: Generating web/Node.js verification commands for mobile tasks.**
**FORBIDDEN: Silently defaulting to web_node without consulting Task Target and plan.md Platform.**

#### 4.3 Generate index.md

Create `FEATURE_DIR/index.md` using `templates/index-template.md`:
- Feature name and branch
- Quick Navigation table with all documents
- Requirements summary table
- Current phase set to "Implementation"
- Task progress (Total/Completed/In Progress)
- Task queue listing

#### 4.4 Generate traceability.md

Create `FEATURE_DIR/traceability.md` using `templates/traceability-template.md`:
- Map every FR-XXX to its task ID(s)
- Map every task to its requirement(s)
- Initialize all statuses to "Pending"
- Calculate coverage metrics (MUST be 100%)

#### 4.5 Stamp Lifecycle Markers on every generated artifact (v0.3+, per Constitution Directive 9)

For each artifact just generated, use the **closed-init** mode (`--closed` flag) which writes both start and end timestamps in ONE atomic call. Tasks generation is synchronous — the file is fully written within this command — so the start/end window is microseconds (not a meaningful resume target). Closed-init halves the script invocations (from 3 → 1 per file) and removes the partial-failure window between start and end on the same file.

Task files get the `both` lifecycle (they will carry implementation stamps too, written by `/atomicspec.implement`); `index.md` and `traceability.md` get `authoring` only.

Run with `set -e` discipline so any per-file failure aborts the whole step — partial stamp state is worse than no stamp state (the orientation procedure would mis-detect).

```bash
set -e
# Task files (both lifecycles, with author-set verify-depth):
for task_file in "$FEATURE_DIR"/tasks/T-*.md; do
  # Verify-depth heuristic: wiring tasks (T-037..T-039, T-057..T-059, T-077..T-079)
  # and tasks touching auth, payment, security, or billing domain -> deep. Else light.
  case "$task_file" in
    *T-03[7-9]-*|*T-05[7-9]-*|*T-07[7-9]-*|*auth*|*payment*|*security*|*billing*)
      verify_depth=deep ;;
    *) verify_depth=light ;;
  esac
  scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh init "$task_file" --lifecycle both --closed \
    --provider {{AGENT_NAME}} --verify-depth "$verify_depth"
done

# Dashboard + ledger (authoring only):
scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh init "$FEATURE_DIR/index.md"        --lifecycle authoring --closed --provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh init "$FEATURE_DIR/traceability.md" --lifecycle authoring --closed --provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
```

```powershell
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'
Get-ChildItem -Path "$FEATURE_DIR\tasks" -Filter 'T-*.md' | ForEach-Object {
  $vd = if ($_.Name -match 'T-(037|038|039|057|058|059|077|078|079)-' -or
            $_.Name -match '(auth|payment|security|billing)') { 'deep' } else { 'light' }
  scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command init -Artifact $_.FullName -Lifecycle both -Closed `
    -Provider {{AGENT_NAME}} -VerifyDepth $vd
}
scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command init -Artifact "$FEATURE_DIR\index.md"        -Lifecycle authoring -Closed -Provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command init -Artifact "$FEATURE_DIR\traceability.md" -Lifecycle authoring -Closed -Provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
```

**Why verify-depth is set here, not in /implement**: Article IX, Directive 9 says the AUTHOR decides verify-depth and the RESUMER obeys. The /atomicspec.tasks command authors the task files, so verify-depth is finalized at generation time and never re-decided downstream. This prevents the "two AIs make different verify decisions on resume" pathology.

**Recovery**: if the loop aborts mid-batch (disk full, permission, etc.), `set -e` halts immediately. Re-running this step is safe — `init` is idempotent on files where the stamp lines are already present, so partially-stamped batches resume cleanly from the next file.

### 5. Validation

Before completing, verify:

- [ ] `index.md` exists with complete navigation
- [ ] `traceability.md` exists with 100% requirement coverage
- [ ] `tasks/` directory exists with individual task files
- [ ] Each task file has all 4 required elements:
  - [ ] ID (T-XXX-name format)
  - [ ] Requirement Mapping (FR-XXX)
  - [ ] Technical Implementation Detail (file paths)
  - [ ] Verification Command (executable, no placeholders)
- [ ] No orphan tasks (all tasks map to requirements)
- [ ] No uncovered requirements (all requirements have tasks)
- [ ] All verification commands are executable
- [ ] Every task has a valid Task Target (backend, frontend, mobile, or shared)
- [ ] Verification commands match the task's Task Target (not just project platform)
- [ ] Cross-target dependencies are wired (API producer->consumer, shared type->consumer, migration->seed)
- [ ] No cross-platform verification commands (e.g., no `npm test` in a mobile task)

### 6. Report

Output summary:
- Path to index.md
- Total task count
- Task count per user story
- Coverage percentage (should be 100%)
- List of task files created

**FORBIDDEN outputs** (Constitution violation):
- ❌ A single tasks.md file with checkbox lists
- ❌ Tasks without verification commands
- ❌ Tasks without requirement mappings

## Verification Command Requirements

**Every task MUST have an executable verification command appropriate to the project's platform.**

See Section 4.2.4 for platform detection and `templates/verification-commands.yaml` for complete templates.

### Good Examples by Platform

**Web/Node.js:**
```bash
npm test -- --grep "UserModel creates valid user"
npx tsc --noEmit src/models/user.ts
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/users | jq '.data | length > 0'
```

**iOS (Swift/Xcode):**
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:MyAppTests/UserModelTests | xcpretty
swift test --filter UserModelTests
swiftlint lint Sources/Models/User.swift --strict
```

**Android (Kotlin/Gradle):**
```bash
./gradlew test --tests "com.myapp.models.UserModelTest"
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew lintDebug
```

**React Native:**
```bash
npx jest --testNamePattern="UserModel"
npx detox test --configuration ios.sim.debug --testNamePattern "User"
```

**Flutter:**
```bash
flutter test --name "UserModel"
dart analyze lib/models/user.dart
```

**Python:**
```bash
pytest -xvs -k "test_user_model"
ruff check src/models/user.py
mypy src/models/user.py --strict
```

**Go:**
```bash
go test -v -run "TestUserModel" ./internal/models/...
golangci-lint run ./internal/models/user.go
```

### Forbidden Patterns

```bash
# TOO VAGUE - no specific target
npm test
./gradlew test
flutter test

# WRONG PLATFORM - using npm for iOS project
npm test -- --grep "AuthService"  # WRONG for iOS!

# MANUAL - not executable
"Check the UI manually"
"Verify in Xcode that..."

# PLACEHOLDER - not complete
[TODO: add verification]
```

## Context Pinning Reminder

Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 3, the subsequent `/atomicspec.implement` command will:
- Read ONLY `index.md` for navigation
- Read ONLY the specific `T-XXX-[name].md` for the current task
- Update `traceability.md` after each completion
- **NEVER** read the full `plan.md` during implementation

Context for task generation: {ARGS}
