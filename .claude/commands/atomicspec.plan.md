## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH.

1.5. **Pre-flight: detect unfinished earlier work (v0.3+, per Constitution Directive 9)**:

   Check BOTH `spec.md` AND `clarify-log.md` (the latter only if it exists — clarify is optional). Either being in `authoring_in_progress` blocks planning.

   ```bash
   scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh status "$FEATURE_SPEC" --json
   # If clarify-log.md exists, also:
   [ -f "$SPECS_DIR/$BRANCH/clarify-log.md" ] && scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh status "$SPECS_DIR/$BRANCH/clarify-log.md" --json
   ```
   ```powershell
   scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command status -Artifact "$FEATURE_SPEC" -Json
   $clog = "$SPECS_DIR\$BRANCH\clarify-log.md"
   if (Test-Path $clog) { scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command status -Artifact $clog -Json }
   ```

   Parse each JSON. If ANY reports `state=authoring_in_progress`, ABORT with:
   > "Unfinished <phase> detected (artifact: <path>, started <ts> by <provider>). Run /atomicspec.<phase> to finish, or /atomicspec.implement for the full resume procedure."

   This is the lightweight cross-phase guard. Only `/atomicspec.implement` performs the full Phase 0 Orientation.

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

2.5. **Stamp Lifecycle Markers — open authoring on plan.md (v0.3+)**:

   IMPL_PLAN was just copied by setup-plan and contains the `## Lifecycle Markers` heading. Initialize and open the authoring lifecycle:

   ```bash
   scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh init  "$IMPL_PLAN" --lifecycle authoring
   scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh start "$IMPL_PLAN" --lifecycle authoring --provider {{AGENT_NAME}} --verify-depth deep
   ```
   ```powershell
   scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command init  -Artifact "$IMPL_PLAN" -Lifecycle authoring
   scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command start -Artifact "$IMPL_PLAN" -Lifecycle authoring -Provider {{AGENT_NAME}} -VerifyDepth deep
   ```

   `verify-depth deep` is set on plan.md because plan changes touch many downstream decisions — light verify on a half-done plan is insufficient. The resumer obeys this value; do not re-decide.

3. **Load Project Defaults Registry + Interview Gate (v0.2+)**: Read `specs/_defaults/registry.yaml` per Constitution Directive 7. Extract existing defaults to pre-populate decisions.

   **Interview gate (v0.2+)** — before any planning work, check the registry's `interview_completed` field:

   - **Validate `interview_completed` value type**: must be either `null`, missing, or a valid ISO date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`). If a truthy non-date value is found (e.g. `true`, `yes`, `1`), treat it as `null` and proceed to the null branch.

   - **If `interview_completed: null` (or missing or malformed)** (genesis behaviour):
     - Use `AskUserQuestion` (don't abort — let the user choose):
       ```
       The pre-plan interview hasn't been completed. The architectural-lurker
       registry fields aren't pinned, so /atomicspec.plan will either need to
       AskUserQuestion at every structural decision (per Directive 7) or make
       assumptions you'll have to clean up later.

       How do you want to handle it?
         A) Run /atomicspec.clarify now (recommended) — ~5-15 min, then come back
         B) Proceed with assumed defaults — plan will AskUserQuestion inline
            as structural decisions arise (slower, less structured)
         C) Cancel — exit /atomicspec.plan without doing anything
       ```
     - If user picks A: abort with exit code 0 (redirect) and print: `Run /atomicspec.clarify, then re-run /atomicspec.plan.`
     - If user picks B: set the plan.md frontmatter field `interview_skipped: true` and proceed. Downstream phases will flag this in their reports.
     - If user picks C: abort with exit code 0 and print a one-line confirmation.

   - **If `interview_completed: <YYYY-MM-DD>` (valid date)**:
     - Proceed normally. Phase 0.5/0.7 checkpoints will still surface assumptions, but the baseline is "interview ran on `<date>`".
     - If `<date>` is more than 90 days old AND the spec mentions new infrastructure areas (e.g. payment / email / scheduling) NOT pinned in the registry, advise (do not block): "Interview is N days old; consider running `/atomicspec.clarify` again to top up registry decisions for new feature areas."

   - **If the registry file is absent entirely**:
     - Instruct the user to run `/atomicspec.registry` first (it scaffolds the registry from project manifests), then return to plan. Do NOT call the gate's AskUserQuestion in this case; the user has different work to do first.

4. **Initial Configuration (HITL)**: Use AskUserQuestion to gather preferences before starting work.

5. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template with configured preferences.

6. **Registry Sync (HITL)**: After all decisions are made, sync new decisions to registry with user approval.

6.5. **Stamp Lifecycle Markers — close authoring on plan.md (v0.3+)**:

   ONLY after all of:
   - Phase 13 gates pass (`check-prerequisites.sh --check-gates --gate-context plan`)
   - All 4 HITL checkpoints recorded in plan.md
   - Registry Sync (step 6) confirmed by user

   close the authoring lifecycle:

   ```bash
   scripts/bash/stamp-lifecycle.sh end "$IMPL_PLAN" --lifecycle authoring --provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
   ```
   ```powershell
   scripts\powershell\stamp-lifecycle.ps1 -Command end -Artifact "$IMPL_PLAN" -Lifecycle authoring -Provider {{AGENT_NAME}}
   ```

   If any gate failed, do NOT write the end stamp — the plan is intentionally left open so the next session can resume from where the gate failed.

7. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 1 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Initial Configuration

**MANDATORY: Before any planning work, interview the user using AskUserQuestion.**

### Configuration Interview

Use AskUserQuestion with the following questions:

```
Question 1: "Would you like to use specialized subagents for this planning phase?"
Header: "Subagents"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, use specialized agents (Recommended)"
    Description: "AI will use domain-specific agents (API design, data architecture, etc.) if available in .specify/subagents/"
  - Label: "No, use general knowledge"
    Description: "AI will handle all domains with general knowledge - faster but less specialized"

Question 2: "Do you have existing competitive analysis for this feature?"
Header: "Competitive"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, at competitive-analysis/summary.md"
    Description: "AI will use your competitive insights to inform technical decisions"
  - Label: "No competitive analysis"
    Description: "AI will make decisions based on general best practices"
  - Label: "Run /atomicspec.AnalyzeCompetitors first"
    Description: "Stop here and run competitive analysis before planning"

Question 3: "What level of detail do you want for HITL checkpoints?"
Header: "Review depth"
Options:
  - Label: "Full review (Recommended)"
    Description: "Pause for approval at each checkpoint with detailed options"
  - Label: "Quick review"
    Description: "Show summary, ask for quick approval"
  - Label: "Auto-approve with logging"
    Description: "Proceed automatically, log decisions for later review"
```

### Subagent Discovery

If user selected "Yes, use specialized agents":

1. **Scan the subagents folder** at `.specify/subagents/`:
   - Recursively list all `**/*.md` files in the folder and all subdirectories
   - **Exclude** files starting with `_` (e.g., `_index.md`, `_template.md`)

2. **For each subagent file found**, read the YAML frontmatter to extract:
   - `name`: The subagent identifier
   - `description`: What it does and when to use it
   - `model`: Which model it prefers (if specified)

3. **List discovered subagents to the user** (names shown are **illustrative only** — real output is populated from the files actually present under `.specify/subagents/`):
   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📦 DISCOVERED SUBAGENTS
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Found [N] specialized subagents in .specify/subagents/:

   | Subagent            | Domain (from YAML description)          |
   |---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
   | <name from file 1>  | <description from file 1>               |
   | <name from file 2>  | <description from file 2>               |
   | [...]               | [...]                                   |

   These agents will be matched dynamically to tasks in later
   phases per _subagent-discovery.md (semantic-similarity scoring).
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

   Do NOT hardcode or assume specific agent names exist — every entry in the rendered table must come from an actual file on disk.

4. **If no subagents found** (empty folder), inform user:
   ```
   No subagents found in .specify/subagents/
   Falling back to general knowledge for all domains.
   ```

5. **Store discovered agents** in plan.md for later reference during Phase 1

### Record Configuration

Store configuration in plan.md:

```markdown
## Planning Configuration

**Configured At**: [timestamp]
**Detected Platform**: [web/ios/android/react-native/flutter/backend-only/both]

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Platform | [web/ios/android/react-native/flutter/backend-only/both] |
| Subagents | [Enabled/Disabled] |
| Available Subagents | [list or "None"] |
| Competitive Analysis | [Yes/No/Pending] |
| Review Depth | [Full/Quick/Auto] |
```

## Phases

### Phase 0.0: Load Project Defaults Registry

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 7 - This step is MANDATORY.**

Before any planning work, load the project defaults registry:

1. **Read registry file**:
   ```
   Read: specs/_defaults/registry.yaml
   ```

2. **If registry exists**, extract relevant sections for planning:
   - `architecture.*` - **CRITICAL**: System pattern, layers, API style, communication
   - `code_patterns.*` - Data access, DI, error handling, validation approach
   - `api.*` - API versioning, pagination, error format, resource naming
   - `backend.*` - Language, framework, ORM, auth, caching
   - `frontend.*` - Framework, rendering, UI library, state management
   - `database.*` - Type, tenancy model, migrations, naming conventions
   - `error_handling.*` - Logging format, error tracking, tracing
   - `testing.*` - Frameworks, coverage targets
   - `security.*` - CORS, CSRF, rate limiting
   - `conventions.*` - Naming conventions, commit format
   - `ui_specs.*` - Dark mode, responsive, accessibility

   **Architecture is foundational** - if `architecture.*` is null, prompt user to set it first:
   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ⚠️ ARCHITECTURE NOT DEFINED
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   The project registry has no architecture defined yet.
   Architecture decisions affect EVERYTHING else.

   We need to establish:
   - System pattern (monolith vs microservices vs serverless)
   - Code layers (clean architecture vs MVC vs vertical slice)
   - API style (REST vs GraphQL vs gRPC)
   - Communication (sync vs async vs event-driven)

   These will be set during the Tech Stack Review checkpoint.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

3. **If registry doesn't exist**, STOP and direct the user to create it:
   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   🛑 PROJECT DEFAULTS REGISTRY NOT FOUND
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   No registry found at specs/_defaults/registry.yaml

   Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 7, all planning MUST read
   project defaults from this file. Without it, every decision in this
   plan becomes feature-specific — exactly the drift this framework
   exists to prevent.

   Recommended: run /atomicspec.registry first. It will:
     1. Scan your project manifests (package.json, pyproject.toml,
        Cargo.toml, go.mod, Dockerfile, CI workflows, etc.)
     2. Present discovered values for your confirmation (batched HITL)
     3. Interview you for non-discoverable fields (tenancy, architecture)
     4. Write specs/_defaults/registry.yaml + changelog.md atomically

   Then re-run /atomicspec.plan.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

   Use `AskUserQuestion` with three choices:
   - **Pause and run `/atomicspec.registry` now** (recommended) — halt planning; user runs the discovery command, then restarts `/atomicspec.plan`
   - **Proceed without registry (explicit override)** — continue with every decision marked `Source: Assumed (no registry)`; Phase 0.9 will offer to create the registry from accumulated decisions
   - **Cancel** — abort `/atomicspec.plan`

   Do NOT silently proceed. The Atomic Traceability Model requires the absence to be made visible.

4. **If registry exists but is EMPTY** (all values `null`): warn but proceed. Phase 0.9 (Registry Sync) will populate it from the decisions made during this plan.

5. **Store loaded defaults** for use in subsequent phases:
   - These will pre-populate tech stack decisions
   - Any decision matching registry = Source: "Registry"
   - Any decision NOT in registry = Source: "Assumed" (candidate for registry)

**Output**: Registry defaults loaded into planning context

### Phase 0.1: Platform Detection (MANDATORY - NEVER SKIP)

**This phase runs for ALL features, including backend-only.**

**See also**: `.specify/knowledge/_platform-resolution.md` for the canonical platform resolution algorithm that ALL commands must follow.

Platform detection must happen BEFORE tech stack validation because:
- A backend FOR a mobile app is different from a backend for web
- Platform determines verification commands, subagent selection, and wiring requirements
- Tech stack validation (Phase 0.5-0.7) needs platform context

**Registry Validation (per _platform-resolution.md)**:
Before proceeding, validate the registry exists and has target_platform set. Never silently default to web.

1. **Check spec.md for Platform header**:
   ```
   Read: FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
   → Look for "Platform:" header in frontmatter or body
   ```

2. **If not in spec.md, check registry**:
   ```
   Read: specs/_defaults/registry.yaml
   → Look for target_platform.primary
   ```

3. **If still unknown, ask user**:
   ```
   Question: "What is the target platform for this feature?"
   Header: "Platform"
   Options:
     - Label: "Web (Browser)"
       Description: "React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, or similar web framework"
     - Label: "iOS (Native)"
       Description: "Swift/SwiftUI or UIKit"
     - Label: "Android (Native)"
       Description: "Kotlin/Jetpack Compose or XML Views"
     - Label: "React Native"
       Description: "Cross-platform with React Native"
     - Label: "Flutter"
       Description: "Cross-platform with Flutter/Dart"
     - Label: "Backend-only"
       Description: "API, CLI, worker, or service with no UI"
     - Label: "Mobile + Backend"
       Description: "Mobile app with its own backend/API (interviews for BOTH stacks)"
   ```

   If user selects "Mobile + Backend", ask follow-up:
   ```
   Question: "Which mobile framework for the frontend?"
   Header: "Mobile Framework"
   Options:
     - Label: "iOS (Native)"
       Description: "Swift/SwiftUI or UIKit"
     - Label: "Android (Native)"
       Description: "Kotlin/Jetpack Compose or XML Views"
     - Label: "React Native"
       Description: "Cross-platform with React Native"
     - Label: "Flutter"
       Description: "Cross-platform with Flutter/Dart"
   ```
   Store the selected mobile framework in `mobile_framework` registry field.
   Store `Detected Platform: both`.

4. **Store detected platform** in plan.md output header:
   ```markdown
   ## Planning Configuration

   **Configured At**: [timestamp]
   **Detected Platform**: [web/ios/android/react-native/flutter/backend-only/both]

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|-------|
   | Platform | [detected value] |
   | Subagents | [Enabled/Disabled] |
   ...
   ```

**Why this matters**: Even backend-only features need platform context. A REST API for a mobile app may need different response formats, pagination styles, or authentication flows than one for web. This information propagates to:
- Tech stack validation commands (Phase 0.6)
- Subagent selection (mobile subagents vs web subagents)
- Knowledge wiring in generated tasks

**Output**: Platform detected and stored in plan.md configuration

### Phase 0.2: Load Domain Knowledge (Assembly Line Manual)

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 8 - This step is MANDATORY.**

Before designing, load relevant stations and subagents based on feature domains.

**⚠️ DO NOT hard-code agent names. Use dynamic discovery.**

1. **Discover available subagents**:

   a. **Scan the subagents folder** at `.specify/subagents/`:
      - Recursively list all `**/*.md` files in the folder and all subdirectories
      - **Exclude** files starting with `_` (e.g., `_index.md`, `_template.md`)

   b. **For each subagent file found**, read the YAML frontmatter to extract:
      - `name`: The subagent identifier
      - `description`: What it does and when to use it (contains matching keywords)

   c. **Build an agent catalog** with extracted descriptions:
      ```
      | Agent Name | Description (for matching) |
      |------------|---------------------------|
      | [name from frontmatter] | [description from frontmatter] |
      | ... | ... |
      ```

2. **Extract domain keywords from spec.md**:

   Scan the feature specification for domain-relevant terms:
   - Technical terms: API, database, auth, payment, UI, tests, deploy, etc.
   - User story contexts: "user can pay", "admin dashboard", "login flow"
   - Entity mentions: users, orders, subscriptions, products, etc.
   - Actions: create, update, delete, search, filter, etc.

3. **Match spec keywords to agent descriptions** (semantic similarity):

   For each agent in the catalog:
   a. Check if agent's `description` contains keywords from the spec
   b. Check if spec context relates to agent's stated purpose
   c. **Score match quality**:
      - Multiple keyword matches → Strong match (load this agent)
      - Single keyword match → Moderate match (consider loading)
      - No overlap → Do not load

   **Example matching**:
   - Spec mentions "REST API", "endpoints" → Agent with "REST, API, microservice" in description → Match
   - Spec mentions "payment", "subscription" → Agent with "payment, billing, stripe" → Match
   - Spec mentions "React components" → Agent with "components, UI, frontend" → Match

4. **For each matched agent**:

   a. **Load the subagent file**:
      ```
      Read: .specify/subagents/[matched-agent-name].md
      ```

   b. **Extract and store**:
      - Key patterns/rules (e.g., "Every query MUST filter by tenant_id")
      - Gate criteria checklists
      - Common pitfalls to avoid
      - Required outputs/artifacts

5. **If no subagents exist but stations might help**:

   Fall back to station discovery:
   ```
   Read: .specify/knowledge/stations/00-station-map.md
   → Find relevant station for unmatched domain
   → Read: .specify/knowledge/stations/[XX]-[domain].md
   ```

6. **If NO knowledge base exists** (no stations, no subagents):

   Use AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   Question: "No Assembly Line knowledge base found. How should we proceed?"
   Header: "Knowledge"
   Options:
     - Label: "Use general best practices (Recommended)"
       Description: "AI will use training knowledge - less SaaS-specific"
     - Label: "Set up defaults now"
       Description: "I'll answer questions to establish patterns"
     - Label: "Import from template"
       Description: "Use a standard SaaS template as starting point"
   ```

4. **Report loaded knowledge**:

   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📚 DOMAIN KNOWLEDGE LOADED
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Detected domains from spec:
   - [domain 1]: Loaded from [subagent/station]
   - [domain 2]: Loaded from [subagent/station]
   - [domain 3]: No knowledge available - using general practices

   Key rules that will be applied:
   - [Rule 1 from domain 1]
   - [Rule 2 from domain 1]
   - [Rule 3 from domain 2]

   Gate criteria to verify:
   - [ ] [Gate from domain 1]
   - [ ] [Gate from domain 2]
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

5. **Store loaded knowledge** for use in subsequent phases:
   - These patterns inform data model design
   - Gate criteria will be embedded in task files during `/atomicspec.tasks`
   - Rules will be applied during code review

**Output**: Domain knowledge loaded into planning context, rules documented

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 0.5: Tech Stack Review Checkpoint (HITL #1)

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 6 - This checkpoint is MANDATORY.**

After Phase 0 completes, present the tech stack and get approval:

⚠️ **CRITICAL EXECUTION ORDER - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:**

1. **FIRST: Output the summary table as plain text** (DO NOT use AskUserQuestion yet!):

   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   🛑 TECH STACK REVIEW - Phase 0.5 Checkpoint
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Based on your spec, registry defaults, and research:

   | Decision          | Value             | Source       |
   |-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
   | Target Platform   | [from Phase 0.1]  | Phase 0.1    |
   | Language/Version  | [value]           | Registry/Spec/Assumed |
   | Primary Framework | [value]           | Registry/Spec/Assumed |
   | Storage           | [value]           | Registry/Spec/Assumed |
   | ORM/Data Layer    | [value]           | Registry/Spec/Assumed |
   | Testing Framework | [value]           | Registry/Spec/Assumed |

   Source Legend:
   - Phase 0.1 = Detected in Platform Detection phase
   - Registry = From specs/_defaults/registry.yaml (project standard)
   - Spec = Explicitly stated in feature spec
   - Assumed = Inferred by AI (candidate for registry)

   ⚠️ NEW DECISIONS (not in registry - will prompt to add):
   [list decisions with Source: "Assumed"]
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

   **YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS TABLE TO THE USER BEFORE PROCEEDING.**
   The user cannot approve something they haven't seen.

2. **THEN: Use AskUserQuestion for approval** (only AFTER showing the table above):

   ```
   Question 1: "Do you approve this tech stack?"
   Header: "Tech Stack"
   Options:
     - Label: "Approve all (Recommended)"
       Description: "Accept all decisions as shown above"
     - Label: "Approve with changes"
       Description: "I'll specify what to change"
     - Label: "Reject - need different approach"
       Description: "Start over with different technology choices"

   Question 2: "Select your coding conventions" (multiSelect: true)
   Header: "Conventions"
   Options:
     - Label: "camelCase for variables/functions"
       Description: "JavaScript/TypeScript standard"
     - Label: "snake_case for variables/functions"
       Description: "Python/Ruby standard"
     - Label: "PascalCase for classes/components"
       Description: "Standard for class-based code"
     - Label: "kebab-case for files"
       Description: "URL-friendly file naming"
   ```

3. **Handle "Approve with changes" response**:

   If user selects "Approve with changes", use follow-up AskUserQuestion:

   ```
   Question: "What would you like to change?"
   Header: "Changes"
   Options:
     - Label: "Language/Version"
       Description: "Change programming language or version"
     - Label: "Framework"
       Description: "Change primary framework"
     - Label: "Database/Storage"
       Description: "Change database or storage solution"
     - Label: "Multiple items"
       Description: "I'll specify in detail"
   ```

   Then gather specifics and re-present checkpoint.

4. **Record approval** in plan.md `## Tech Stack Approval` section:
   - Mark all decisions as approved
   - Add approval timestamp
   - Record selected coding conventions
   - Note any revisions made

5. **Skip conditions** (if ALL are true AND Review Depth = "Auto-approve"):
   - Every Technical Context field was explicit in spec (Source = "Spec" for all)
   - No assumptions were made

**Output**: User-approved technical decisions and coding conventions recorded in plan.md

### Phase 0.6: Tech Stack Validation

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 6 - This validation is MANDATORY after HITL #1.**

After the user approves tech stack CHOICES (Phase 0.5), run compatibility validation:

1. **Run validation script**:

   Run `{VALIDATION_SCRIPT}` to check:
   - Package freshness (last publish date)
   - Deprecation notices
   - Peer dependency conflicts
   - Version compatibility
   - Known issues

2. **Parse validation results**:

   The script returns JSON with status and findings:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "PASS | PASS_WITH_WARNINGS | FAIL",
     "packages": [...],
     "warnings": [...]
   }
   ```

3. **Update plan.md** `## Tech Stack Validation` section with results.

**Output**: Validation results populated in plan.md

### Phase 0.7: Validation Review Checkpoint (HITL #2)

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 6 - This checkpoint is MANDATORY if warnings exist.**

If validation found warnings or issues, present them and get decisions:

⚠️ **CRITICAL EXECUTION ORDER - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:**

1. **FIRST: Output the validation summary as plain text** (DO NOT use AskUserQuestion yet!):

   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   🔍 TECH STACK VALIDATION - Phase 0.7 Checkpoint
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Validation Status: [PASS_WITH_WARNINGS]

   | Package       | Proposed | Validated | Status | Notes              |
   |---------------|----------|-----------|--------|--------------------|
   | [package]     | latest   | 5.7.1     | WARN   | [issue found]      |

   ⚠️ WARNINGS FOUND: [count] issues requiring decision
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

   **YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS TABLE TO THE USER BEFORE PROCEEDING.**
   The user cannot make decisions about warnings they haven't seen.

2. **THEN: Use AskUserQuestion for each warning** (only AFTER showing the table above):

   ```
   Question: "[Package] has compatibility warning: [issue]. How should we proceed?"
   Header: "[Package]"
   Options:
     - Label: "Accept recommendation (Recommended)"
       Description: "[specific recommendation, e.g., 'Upgrade to v5.15+']"
     - Label: "Keep current version"
       Description: "I accept the risk - will be documented"
     - Label: "Use alternative package"
       Description: "I'll specify a different package"
     - Label: "Need more information"
       Description: "Explain the issue in more detail"
   ```

3. **Handle responses**:
   - "Accept recommendation" → Apply fix, continue
   - "Keep current version" → Use follow-up AskUserQuestion for reason:
     ```
     Question: "Please provide a reason for accepting this risk (for documentation)"
     Header: "Override reason"
     Options:
       - Label: "Deployment environment handles it"
         Description: "Our infrastructure mitigates this issue"
       - Label: "Will address post-MVP"
         Description: "Known tech debt, will fix later"
       - Label: "Not applicable to our use case"
         Description: "The warning doesn't affect our implementation"
     ```
   - "Use alternative package" → Ask for alternative, re-run validation
   - "Need more information" → Explain, then re-ask

4. **Record in plan.md** `## Tech Stack Validation` section:
   - Update Validation Status
   - Add any user overrides with their selected reasons
   - Add validation approval timestamp

5. **Loop handling**:
   - If user changes packages, re-run Phase 0.6 validation
   - Continue until all warnings are resolved (accepted, overridden, or fixed)

6. **Skip conditions** (validation review may be skipped if):
   - Validation status is PASS (no warnings)
   - Review Depth = "Auto-approve" (log decisions automatically)

**Output**: User-reviewed validation with documented decisions

### Phase 0.8: Frontend/UI Specifications Checkpoint (HITL #3)

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 6 - This checkpoint is MANDATORY if feature has UI.**

After tech stack validation, if the feature involves frontend/UI, gather UI framework specifications.

⚠️ **CRITICAL EXECUTION ORDER - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY:**

---

#### Step 1: Check if UI specifications are needed

**Platform was already detected in Phase 0.1.** This phase focuses on UI FRAMEWORK specifics.

Skip this phase ONLY if:
- Platform = "backend-only" (detected in Phase 0.1)
- User explicitly marked "No UI" in spec

**DO NOT skip this phase just because it's a backend feature.** If the backend serves a mobile app, the platform context (detected in Phase 0.1) is still valuable, but UI framework questions can be skipped.

---

#### Step 1.5: COMPOSITE PLATFORM HANDLING (Platform = "both" only)

**This block ONLY triggers when Detected Platform = "both". For single platforms, skip entirely to Step 2.**

When Platform = "both", this feature targets a mobile frontend with its own backend/API. Both stacks need specification:

1. **Read mobile framework from registry/plan config**:
   ```
   Read from plan.md: "Detected Platform: both"
   Read from registry or plan config: mobile_framework → [ios/android/react-native/flutter]
   ```

2. **Run mobile platform interview branch**:
   Based on `mobile_framework`, execute the corresponding mobile platform branch questions below (iOS, Android, React Native, or Flutter) to gather UI framework specifics for the mobile frontend.
   Record results under the appropriate `mobile_*` registry fields (`mobile_framework`, `mobile_platforms`).

3. **Present backend tech stack questions**:
   ```
   Question 1: "What backend language?"
   Header: "Backend Language"
   Options:
     - Label: "TypeScript/Node.js"
     - Label: "Python"
     - Label: "Go"
     - Label: "Rust"
     - Label: "Java/Kotlin"
     - Label: "Other"
   Store → backend.language

   Question 2: "What backend framework?"
   Header: "Backend Framework"
   (Options vary by selected language, e.g., Express/Fastify/NestJS for Node, Django/FastAPI for Python, etc.)
   Store → backend.framework

   Question 3: "What ORM/database layer?"
   Header: "ORM / Database Layer"
   (Options vary by selected language, e.g., Prisma/Drizzle/TypeORM for Node, SQLAlchemy/Django ORM for Python, etc.)
   Store → backend.orm
   ```

4. **Record both stacks in plan.md**:
   ```markdown
   ### Composite Stack (Platform = both)

   **Mobile Frontend**:
   - Framework: [mobile_framework value]
   - Platforms: [mobile_platforms value]
   - UI specifications: [from mobile branch interview above]

   **Backend/API**:
   - Language: [backend.language]
   - Framework: [backend.framework]
   - ORM: [backend.orm]
   ```

After completing this composite block, skip Step 3 and Step 4 (single-platform branches) and proceed directly to Phase 0.9.

---

#### Step 2: Retrieve detected platform

The platform was detected in Phase 0.1 and stored in plan.md configuration.

```
Read from plan.md: "Detected Platform: [value]"
```

If platform is "backend-only", skip to Phase 0.9.

---

#### Step 3: Present platform-specific context

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🎨 FRONTEND/UI SPECIFICATIONS - Phase 0.8 Checkpoint
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Your tech stack includes frontend work. Let's define UI standards
to ensure consistent implementation across all components.

Detected Platform: [Web/iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter]
Detected Framework: [React/SwiftUI/Jetpack Compose/etc.]
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**YOU MUST OUTPUT THIS CONTEXT TO THE USER BEFORE PROCEEDING.**

Header: "Custom UI"
Options:
  - Label: "Yes, I have more requirements"
    Description: "I'll describe additional UI rules/constraints"
  - Label: "No, these choices are complete"

---

#### Step 7: Final UI confirmation

Present summary and confirm:

```
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 UI SPECIFICATIONS SUMMARY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Platform: [Web/iOS/Android/React Native/Flutter]

| Setting          | Value                    | Registry Key                |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| UI Framework     | [selected]               | [platform].ui_framework      |
| State Management | [selected]               | [platform].state_management  |
| Navigation       | [selected]               | [platform].navigation        |
| Data Persistence | [selected]               | [platform].local_database    |
| [Platform-specific] | [selected]            | [platform].[key]             |

Cross-Platform Settings:

    Description: "These specifications are correct"
  - Label: "Make changes"
    Description: "I need to modify some choices"
  - Label: "Add more specifications"
    Description: "I have additional requirements to add"
```

---

#### Step 8: Record in plan.md

Record in `## Frontend/UI Specifications` section:
- Platform detected
- All selected options with registry keys
- Design token source (if applicable)
- Additional requirements
- Approval timestamp

---

#### Step 9: Skip conditions

Skip UI framework questions (Steps 3-8) if:
- Platform = "backend-only" (detected in Phase 0.1)
- User explicitly marked "No UI" in spec
- Review Depth = "Auto-approve" AND all UI choices are in registry

**Note**: Platform detection itself is NEVER skipped - it happens in Phase 0.1 for ALL features. This phase (0.8) only handles UI framework specifics.

**Output**: User-approved UI specifications recorded in plan.md with platform-specific registry keys

### Phase 0.9: Registry Sync Checkpoint (HITL #4)

**Per Constitution Article IX, Directive 7 - This checkpoint is MANDATORY.**

After all tech decisions are approved, sync new decisions to the project registry:

1. **Collect all new decisions** that are NOT already in registry:
   - From Phase 0.5: Language, framework, ORM, database, etc.
   - From Phase 0.8: UI library, state management, form handling, etc.
   - Any conventions selected

2. **Present registry sync summary**:

   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   📋 REGISTRY SYNC - Phase 0.9 Checkpoint
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   The following decisions were made in this planning session
   and are NOT yet in the project defaults registry:

   | Key                      | Value           | Add to Registry? |
   |--------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
   | backend.language         | typescript      | Candidate        |
   | backend.framework        | express         | Candidate        |
   | frontend.ui_library      | shadcn          | Candidate        |
   | frontend.state_management| zustand         | Candidate        |
   | api.versioning           | url             | Candidate        |

   Adding these to the registry means ALL future features
   will use these as defaults (with HITL override option).
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

3. **Use AskUserQuestion for each candidate** (batch if many):

   ```
   Question: "Add these decisions to project defaults registry?"
   Header: "Registry Sync"
   Options:
     - Label: "Add all to registry (Recommended)"
       Description: "All decisions become project defaults for future features"
     - Label: "Select which to add"
       Description: "I'll choose which decisions to add individually"
     - Label: "Skip - keep feature-specific"
       Description: "Don't add any to registry, only apply to this feature"
   ```

4. **If "Select which to add"**, present each decision:

   ```
   Question: "Add [key] = [value] to project defaults?"
   Header: "[category]"
   Options:
     - Label: "Yes, add to registry"
       Description: "Future features will use this by default"
     - Label: "No, feature-specific only"
       Description: "Only this feature uses this setting"
   ```

5. **Update registry files** for approved additions:

   a. **Update `specs/_defaults/registry.yaml`**:
      - Set each approved key to its value
      - Update `last_updated` to current timestamp
      - Update `last_updated_by: human`
      - Add feature to `applied_to` list

   b. **Append to `specs/_defaults/changelog.md`**:
      ```markdown
      ### [DATE] | [key.path]
      - **Changed**: `null` → `[value]`
      - **Why**: Decided during [feature-name] planning
      - **Source**: specs/[feature-name]/plan.md
      - **Approved by**: Human (accept)
      ```

6. **Report sync results**:

   ```
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ✅ REGISTRY SYNC COMPLETE
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   Added to registry: [count] decisions
   Kept feature-specific: [count] decisions

   Updated files:
   - specs/_defaults/registry.yaml
   - specs/_defaults/changelog.md

   Future features will inherit these project defaults.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

7. **Skip conditions**:
   - No new decisions were made (all came from registry)
   - Review Depth = "Auto-approve" (add all automatically, log in changelog)

**Output**: Registry updated with user-approved defaults, changelog appended

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete, Tech Stack Validation complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `{AGENT_SCRIPT}`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
